# Dave's Simple Chat Service

I've been playing around with Node.js recently and taking some of the neat online lessons available through [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/). One of the lessons involved streaming realtime data between the client and server using [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).

This sounded insanely powerful and fund, so I took a break from the rest of the lessons and started playing around with Socket.io. They have a tutorial that explains [how to build a simple, realtime chat application](http://socket.io/) using its library in about 20 minutes.

This little web app is more or less a result of tutorial and I've added some additional stuff as I played around with it (e.g., Ask for and display usernames).
